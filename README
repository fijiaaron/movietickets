Test automation for MovieTickets.com

Selenium + JUnit test cases for ZipCodeLookup and TopMovies are available under java/MovieTickets.

DOS batch files are available for executing tests from the command line:
 ZipCodeLookup.bat
 TopMovies.bat
All that's required to run these tests are to have Java & Firefox installed.  

But running from the command line will not be as illustrative as running from within the Eclipse IDE via the included Junit runner.
To run from Eclipse you need to have Eclipse 3.6(Helios) or 3.7 (Indigo) installed and create a project in Eclipse.  
You then need to add selenium-server-standalone-2.x.x.jar to the build path and run as Junit 4 test case.
